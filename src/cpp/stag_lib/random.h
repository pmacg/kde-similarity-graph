   * n, this method samples from an approximate stochastic block model by
   * default which significantly speeds up the execution time. To sample
   * exactly from the stochastic block model, pass the optional 'exact'
   * parameter to the method.
   *
   * The approximate sampling method has running time O(k^2 + nnz) and the exact
   * method has running time O(n^2) where nnz is the number of non-zeros in the
   * generated graph's adjacency matrix.

   * @param exact (optional) - whether to use the exact probability distribution
   *                           or an approximation.
